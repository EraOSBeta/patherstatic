# Contributing Guidelines
I see you're interested in contributing to this project, so here's some guidelines to help you with that
## Code Clean-up
These are always welcome, whether it's removing redundant code, rewriting solutions, upgrading old code to newer and better ways of handling things, or even just commenting on stuff. Just make sure that you actually improve the code and that it doesn't downgrade the already slow code.
## Bug Fixes
These are usually welcome, specially considering how much my code sucks, but remember to always ask us if something is a bug or if it's actually intended BEFORE attempting to fix it, otherwise you might have wasted your time fixing something that wasn't even a bug
## New Features
These are sometimes welcome, since I don't have many ideas and I struggle to actually implement many of my ideas; however, you MUST discuss your feature with us and the community before implementing it, since we will not accept it if we or the community decide that it's not useful, doesn't fit in the engine's vision, or just seems like an entirely bad idea.
