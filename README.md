- Better than making your own from scratch
- ~~Blazingly fast~~slow python code
- ~~Reliable~~barely functional
- (insert non-existent feature here)
## Setup
Download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/EraOSBeta/patherstatic/releases), make sure Python (3.10) is installed on your machine, setup a virtual environment (OPTIONAL), and execute this command:

`pip install keyboard`

if the required Python version isn't used by default (3.10 in this case):

`python3.10 -m pip install keyboard`

if you're using linux, execute one of the above commands as root or else the module won't work.

Navigate to where you saved patherstatic, open it in the terminal and

`python ./player.py`

if the required Python version isn't used by default (3.10 in this case):

`python3.10 ./player.py`

again, you need to execute this as root on Linux.
